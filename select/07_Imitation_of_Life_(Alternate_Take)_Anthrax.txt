There's nothing I hate more
Than all these plastic people
With all their plastic promises
And all their plastic deals
They just can't be themselves
And live their own lives out
They're just an imitation
Of what life's all about

Because of me you are who you are,
So sign your name and you'll go far
I'm your friend: I think you should
So sign your name, it's for your own good
How many times have you heard this today?
Some bogus piss on saying "Let's do lunch babe"
For them this bullshit, that's their whole life
Cut through their bullshit with a knife
Imitation of Life!
Oh! Oh! Oh! Anger burns!

Whatever happened to the guy I knew
A media creation, a monster grew
Our story had an unhappy end
But this could change, I still call him friend
Take my advice and listen to me
A great opportunity, can't you see?
I only want what's best for you
The deal of a lifetime, what more can I do
How many times have you heard this today?
Some stupid sucker says "It's great, we love you babe"
For them this bullshit, it's their whole life
Cut through their bullshit with a knife
Imitation of Life!
Oh! Oh! Oh! Anger burns!

Bands dress like women with hairspray and lace
I'd pass an image law, stick it in your face!
Let's see how long they keep dressing this way
Wearing this image twenty four hours a day!

Did you ever think for yourself?
Just once, did you ever think?
That's all I want to know

Imitation of Life!
Living out a lie, you'll never be right
Imitation of Life!
Why are you here? You're taking up my space!
The new imperfect race
Imitation of Life!

Oh! Oh! Oh! Anger burns!
Whatever happened to the guy I knew
A media creation, a monster grew
Our story had an unhappy end
But this could change, I still call him friend
There's nothing I hate more
Than all these plastic people
With all their plastic promises
And all their plastic deals
They just can't be themselves
And live their own lives out
They're just an imitation
Of what life's all about

Imitation of Life!

Eh! Oh! Eh! Oh!
