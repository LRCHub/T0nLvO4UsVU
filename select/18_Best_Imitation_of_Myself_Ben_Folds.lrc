[00:01.18] I feel like a quote out of context
[00:03.88] Withholding the rest
[00:05.53] So I can be for you what you want to see
[00:09.93] I got the gestures and sounds
[00:12.28] Got the timing down
[00:14.36] It's uncanny, yeah, you'd think it was me
[00:34.86] 
[00:18.43] Do you think I should take a class
[00:23.57] To lose my southern accent?
[00:27.22] Did I make me up, or make the face till it stuck?
[00:51.72] 
[00:31.46] I do the best imitation of myself
[00:47.96] 
[00:42.70] The problem with you speech
[00:45.07] You gave me was fine
[00:46.93] I liked the theories about my little stage
[00:51.36] And I swore I was listening
[00:52.96] But I started drifting
[00:55.01] Around the part about me acting my age
[01:14.01] 
[00:58.49] Now if it's all the same
[01:03.23] I've people to entertain
[01:07.12] I juggle one handed
[01:09.67] Do some magic tricks and
[01:21.67] 
[01:11.72] The best imitation of myself
[01:25.72] 
[01:16.83] Maybe i'm thinking myself in a hole, wondering
[01:23.24] Who i am when i ought to know
[01:26.63] Straighten up now time to go
[01:30.19] Fool somebody else
[01:33.39] Fool somebody else
[01:42.39] 
[01:41.49] Last night i was east with them and west within
[01:47.06] Trying to be for you what you wanna see
[01:50.86] But i can't help it with you
[01:53.53] The good and bad comes through
[01:55.84] Don't want you hanging out with no one but me
[02:18.34] 
[01:59.04] Now if it's all the same
[02:04.22] It comes from the same place
[02:08.47] And if my mind's somewhere else
[02:10.48] You won't be able to tell
[02:22.98] 
[02:12.50] I do the best imitation of myself
[02:29.00] 
[02:17.14] Yes it's uncanny to see
[02:19.20] You'd really think it was me
[02:21.97] The best imitation of myself
[02:25.96] The best imitation of myself
