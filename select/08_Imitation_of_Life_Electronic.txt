Inside my imagination
There is an imitation of life
You captured me for an instant
Still in your camera and in your life
The head of a hungry pack of hounds
Will track me down

Say it's not over
Let's say a prayer
Let's turn it over
Show that we care.
Walk in the desert
Lie in the shade
We'll be together
Don't be afraid.

Say it's not over.

I'll move to the other side of town
I'll lead you to the underground
We'll live within our hollow space
We're in a dream we both embrace
And if tomorrow is undone
You'll never hear me

Say it's not over
Let's say a prayer
Let's turn it over
Show that we care.
Walk in the desert
Lie in the shade
We'll be together
Don't be afraid.

Say it's not over.
Say it's not over.
Say it's not over.
Say it's not over.

Inside my imagination
There is an imitation of life
You captured me for an instant
Still in your camera and in your life
The head of a hungry pack of hounds
Will track me down
