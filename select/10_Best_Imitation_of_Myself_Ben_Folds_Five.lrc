[00:00.69] I feel like a quote out-of-context, withholding the rest
[00:05.58] So I can be for you what you want to see
[00:10.10] I've got the gesture and sounds, got the timing down
[00:14.69] It's uncanny, yeah, you'd think it was me
[00:35.19] 
[00:18.06] Do you think I should take a class to lose my southern accent?
[00:28.14] Did I make me up, or make the face 'til it stuck?
[00:31.89] I do the best imitation of myself
[00:48.39] 
[00:42.89] The "problem with you" speech you gave me was fine
[00:47.63] I liked the theories about my little stage
[00:51.70] And I swore I was listening, but I started drifting
[00:55.96] Around the part about me acting my age
[01:14.96] 
[00:59.99] Now if it's all the same, I've people to entertain
[01:09.57] I juggle one-handed, do some magic tricks and
[01:13.69] The best imitation of myself
[01:27.69] 
[01:18.44] Maybe I'm thinking myself in a hole
[01:22.30] Wondering who I am, when I ought to know
[01:28.01] Straighten up, now time to go fool somebody else
[01:31.39] Fool somebody else
[01:40.39] 
[01:43.01] Last night I was east with them and west within
[01:48.62] Trying to be for you what you wanna see
[01:52.80] But I can't help it with you, the good and bad comes through
[01:57.13] Don't want you hanging out with no one but me
[02:19.63] 
[02:00.75] Yeah, but it's all the same, it comes from the same place
[02:10.00] And if my mind's somewhere else, you won't be able to tell
[02:14.12] I do the best imitation of myself
[02:18.43] Yes, it's uncanny to see, you'd really think it was me
[02:23.05] It's the best imitation of myself
[02:26.82] I do the best imitation of myself
